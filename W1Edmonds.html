            <h2 class="section-heading">Usability Spotlight</h2>

            <p>Browsing online is generally an easy process today. The rules and guidelines of how we build websites has been 
            solidified a great deal since the 90's. This foundation doesn't account for everything though, most notably the user. 
            People fundamentally use sites in different methods and patterns. As a designer we should accommodate for any ambiguity
            in our work. This is known as User Experience design.</p>

            

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Steve Krug has an excellent book on UX design called “Don’t Make Me Think!”</blockquote>
            
            <a href="http://theedmondstheater.com/home.php">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/edmonds-theatre.png" alt="The Edmonds Theater">
            </a>

            <p>My local historic Movie theater has seemed to have missed a few key usability fundamentals in the design of their website. 
            The <a href="http://theedmondstheater.com/home.php">Edmonds Theater</a> is a landmark but their website is more of a maze. I would think that they would want to showcase their movies and showtimes as a priority. 
            The location and amenities would be useful to those who want to see a show. While those who want to plan something for later would want to see upcoming events or 
            read about the history of the theater. So then why is some of this information harder to find on their website than Facebook?</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">A Hard Look at a Simple Site</h2>

            <p>Let’s look at exactly what I mean when I say that the edmonds theater needs some UX help. To test this let’s look at how well it answers the following questions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Do I have to Question what section is what?</li>
                <li>Can I Tell what I can Click on?</li>
                <li>Can I find the Information I'm looking for in a hurry?</li>
                <li>Do I know where I am on the Site?</li>
                <li>Is the Text Clear and Consice?</li>
            </ul>

            <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/TheaterMain.jpg" alt="The Edmonds Theater Home Page">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Where could I order tickets?</span>

            <h4>Do I have to Question what section is what?</h4>

            <p>Initially this looks fine: there is a header with a sensible navbar, a footer with the address and prices, and the films center frame.  However, there is no mention of showtimes, no events calendar or
             any pictures of the theater itself. Clicking on the nav bar scrolls the page content but not the page itself which seems counterintuitive. </p>

            <h4>Can I Tell what I can Click on?</h4>

            <p>It’s unfortunately not very easy to tell what does what. The Logo, address, and phone number are all just text. The social media Icons work how I would expect but the nav bar scrolls instead of taking me to a new page. There is no visual indicator on the films to show that they
            are indeed clickable. So as I tried to navigate I lost my trust in how a site like this works as my expectations were subverted. Some simple hover css  or color would go a long way here.</p>
            
            <h4>Can I find the Information I'm looking for in a hurry?</h4>

            <p>Most information is readily accessible but there is a glaring exception: Tickets. If I’m checking out a business’ website knowing how to buy their product should be top priority. I can select a film to see its showtimes but I can’t purchase tickets without going to an external site. 
             That isn’t even a link forcing me to search online for another way to buy tickets. I would add a “Buy Tickets” button below each active film that would link directly to a purchase page.</p>

            <a href="#">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/TheaterMenu.jpg" alt="The Edmonds Theater events Page">
            </a>

            <h4>Do I know where I am on the Site?</h4>

            <p>This is the weirdest concept to me. The website is presented in a multiple page format yet is actually a single page. To make that more confusing the text for each section is only grayed out below the previous one
             but you can not scroll. Why? I would rather just scroll down than be forced to use a nav bar particularly if it is visible. I would make this a single page with more horizontal utilization.</p>

            <h4>Is the Text Clear and Consice?</h4>

            <p>The color scheme for the text is great and has solid contrast. The shift in background color helps make the white text pop as you navigate. The content is short and to the point. I would make the text size a bit bigger though as i find it rather small. The background image is also mildly distracting when I’m reading.</p>
