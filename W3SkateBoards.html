        <h2 class="section-heading">Usability Testing?</h2>
        <p>I have talked a lot about the importance of usability in creating a website the last few times. While it is useful
            to see the strengths and weakness’ of other sites we ultimately want to know how to make our own better. The best
            method for doing so? Usability Testing. Steve Krug makes a great point that the benefits of this process are fantastically
                efficient yet surprisingly simple. It only requires a simple script and the site you’re testing to get useful results.
        </p>

        <p>To try this out myself I found a website for a product I’ve been interested in for a while: Leiftech. As a small niche company
            with a unique product they are still trying to get their business rolling. Over the course of a year their website has changed
            format 3 times which got me curious, was there something wrong? I set up some basic audio recording software, wrote down a
            script, and got to work on what I think users might have trouble with.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">What Should I test For?</h2>

        <p>
            I started out by following Steve Krug’s guide to usability testing in his book “Don’t Make Me Think!”. I would tell my participants
            that this was a test of the website not them, that my recording was just for me and would not be shared, and that I was looking for
            honest reactions or opinions. I asked a little about the user’s background to gauge how much they knew about the internet along
            with their occupation. This was all just to set a baseline for the rest of the test.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I really wanted to know about Leiftech’s website was if it was working as intended. I figured as a small business the
            main goal was to get you interested in buying their product. They would also want to make sure that learning about what they
            offered was clear to hopefully convince people on the fence. As this was their main site they would also want to offer support
            to existing customers with issues. I turned these goals into the following tasks I would have my users run through:
